# hello-world
My first whack at github by introducing the traditional "hello world"!
ISSM security nerd by day, family man by night, my name is Juan Ganzon and I've been working in IT and information security for over 10 years now. As a security professional, I maintain my CISSP certification in addition to Security+, Network+, and CCENT. I have a BS in Computer Information Systems from Columbia College and a MS in Information Technology Management with specialization in Information Assurance and Security from Capella University. I also have 3 years experience in C++, assembly, and Java programming languages and therefore I'm quite familiar with the underlying reason for using the hello world as a break into unfamiliar territory where one hopes to become savvy as time goes by.
While information security is my main field of practice, there is a growing need for applying security to software development practices and into the SDLC methodology ensuring that security if not just an after thought but a just as important as the software application being developed. 
My hope is to gain insightful knowledge by peering into Github repositories looking for particular instances where security was present during inception and not just bolted on. With luck and help from others, I look forward to having an understanding with just enough knowledge to apply to my work environment benefitting my team and customers alike.
